In this task, mice were trained to listen to a sound of ascending frequency and to lick to one of 6 possible rewarded ports, where the target frequency was played. 

The scripts here are for analyzing the behavior of the animals and pre-processing the data for further analyses e.g., using P-GAM (Balzani et al., 2020) or CEBRA (Schneider et al., 2023). The scripts are not finalized.
