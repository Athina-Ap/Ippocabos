In this task, water-deprived mice are running back and forth on the linear track. There are three conditions: 
1. 2-ports walls-on (walls built around the track and water at to both ports) 
2. 1-port walls-on (walls built around the track and water delivered at only one port)
3. 2-ports walls-off (standard linear track and water delivered at both ports)
